This WebbApp was developed by Luis Suarez during the 4th Austin Diversity Hackathon.

This hackathon is a celebration of diversity. Anyone who supports diversity is welcome â€” no matter your level of technical knowledge. They provide a space for people of all backgrounds who want to start building their tech portfolio or finish up a tech project while learning new skills. Previous experience in tech is **NOT** required. If you are an advanced coder, they are looking for mentors. They are also looking for volunteers. If you are nervous about attending a hackathon, just volunteer and see what it is all about!
