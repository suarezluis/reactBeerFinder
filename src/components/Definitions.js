        <strong> Alcohol by volume </strong>
      </h6>
      <p>
        Alcohol by volume (abbreviated as ABV, abv, or alc/vol) is a standard
        measure of how much alcohol (ethanol) is contained in a given volume of
        an alcoholic beverage (expressed as a volume percent).[1][2][3] It is
        defined as the number of millilitres (mL) of pure ethanol present in 100
        mL of solution at 20 °C (68 °F). The number of millilitres of pure
        ethanol is the mass of the ethanol divided by its density at 20 °C,
        which is 0.78924 g/mL. The ABV standard is used worldwide. The
        International Organization of Legal Metrology has tables of density of
        water–ethanol mixtures at different concentrations and temperatures.

        <strong> International Bitterness Units </strong>
      </h6>
      <p>
        International Bitterness Units are a chemical measurement of the number
        of bittering compounds, specifically isomerized and oxidized alpha
        acids, polyphenols, and a few other select bittering chemicals, that
        make your beer taste bitter. The IBU correlates well, in most cases,
        with the sensory bitterness of beer, and this is why brewers use it.
        Almost all the beer you’ll ever drink will have a measured IBU between
        five (which is a very low measured bitterness) up to 120 (which is a
        very high measured bitterness). Most beer falls in a narrower range
        within these parameters (between 15-80ish), but that’s the gist of it.

        <strong> Standard Reference Method</strong>
      </h6>
      <p>
        The Standard Reference Method or SRM[1] is one of several systems modern
        brewers use to specify beer color. Determination of the SRM value
        involves measuring the attenuation of light of a particular wavelength
        (430 nm) in passing through 1 cm of the beer, expressing the attenuation
        as an absorption and scaling the absorption by a constant (12.7 for SRM;
        25 for EBC). The SRM (or EBC) number represents a single point in the
        absorption spectrum of beer. As such it cannot convey full color
        information which would require 81 points, but it does remarkably well
        in this regard (it conveys 92% of spectral information) even when fruit
        beers are considered.

        <strong> Original Gravity</strong>
      </h6>
      <p>
        A gravity reading taken just prior to yeast being added, or pitched, is
        referred to as the original gravity (OG). The OG will provide the brewer
        with a good idea of the potential alcohol percentage for that particular
        beer. For example, the OG of an imperial stout at 1.080 (read:
        ten-eighty) has more sugar molecules to be converted into alcohol than
        an ordinary bitter at 1.032 (say it like this: ten thirty-two), this
        explains why the stout will pack more alcohol (~8.0-12.0% ABV) than the
        bitter (3.2-3.8% ABV), and why more malt is needed in the imperial stout
        recipe than the ordinary bitter recipe. The OG reading is very important
        to the execution of the brew and subsequent fermentation of the beer.
        Brewers will track the specific gravity (SG) for the duration of the
        process to make sure that the gravity levels remain consistent from one
        batch to the other and that no problems arise from the malt quality,
        brewing process or yeast productivity.

        <strong> Type of glass</strong>
      </h6>
      <p>
        Glasses aren’t just for noses, though. Perhaps the most important thing
        the right glass can do for beer is affect its taste. Glassware won’t
        magically make bad beer become good, but it will encourage you to pick
        up on the full experience of a beer. A pint glass or mug is made for
        gulps of low-alcohol session beer, while a smaller-mouthed glass forces
        smaller, more concentrated sips.
