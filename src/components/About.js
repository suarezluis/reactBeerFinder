        This hackathon is a celebration of diversity. Anyone who supports
        diversity is welcome â€” no matter your level of technical knowledge. They
        provide a space for people of all backgrounds who want to start building
        their tech portfolio or finish up a tech project while learning new
        skills. Previous experience in tech is **NOT** required. If you are an
        advanced coder, they are looking for mentors. They are also looking for
        volunteers. If you are nervous about attending a hackathon, just
        volunteer and see what it is all about!
